# ExternalDNS Operator

The ExternalDNS Operator deploys and manages [ExternalDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns), which dynamically manages
external DNS records in specific DNS Providers for specific Kubernetes resources.

This Operator is in the early stages of implementation. For the time being, please reference the
[ExternalDNS Operator OpenShift Enhancement Proposal](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/786).

## Deploy operator

### Quick development
1. Build and push the operator image to a registry:
   ```sh
   $ podman build -t <registry>/<username>/external-dns-operator:latest -f Dockerfile .
   $ podman push <registry>/<username>/external-dns-operator:latest
   ```
2. Make sure to uncomment the `image` in `config/manager/kustomization.yaml` and set it to the operator image you pushed
3. Run `oc apply -k config/default`
4. Now you can deploy an instance of ExternalDNS, run `oc apply -k config/samples`
